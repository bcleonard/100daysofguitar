## If you've decided to join:
1. Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofx.com/) for the #100DaysOfGuitar movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfx.com/connect 
2. Fork this repo and commit to the [R1 Log](r1-log.md) (R1 stands for Round 1) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3. **Play a minimum a half hour (30 minutes) every day for the next 100 days.**
4. **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
6. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
7. **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfExercise hashtag.**
9. Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
